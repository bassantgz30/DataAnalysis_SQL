GOAL:
	To identify the top learners in an online learning platform based on daily streaks.

Columns:
	 streak_id: Unique id for each streak record.
     student_id: Unique id for each student.
     streak_active: Boolean, indicating whether the streak is currently active (1) or not (0).
     streak_frozen: Boolean, indicating whether the streak is currently frozen (1) or not (0).
     streak_created: The date when the streak was started or updated.
     
Metric's Calculation:
	- The streak duration increments each day the student remains active, and they havenâ€™t frozen their streak. 
    - The duration is not extended when the student is not active or when the streak is frozen.

-- (1) Understand the Data Structure:
-- ===================================
DESCRIBE students_streaks;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT streak_id) FROM students_streaks;  -- 20174  >> streaks are unique.
SELECT COUNT(distinct student_id) FROM students_streaks;  -- 6638 >> one student may have different streaks.

-- =====================
-- (2) Data Cleaning:
-- =====================

-- Staging step: Creating a copy of the raw data to work on. No changes will be applied to the raw data.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS students_streaks_staging;

-- ==============================
-- (3) Finding the top students:
-- ==============================

-- Staging step: Creating a copy of students_streaks_staging but sorted by student_id and streak_created date.

-- Each student may have different streaks,
/*
## Senarios are:
	- active, not frozen, consicutive days.
    - active, not frozen, separated days.
    - active, frozen
    - not active
    
    We are interested in the first case only for now, so reset streak to 1 for any other case.
    
## We need variables to track the previous date, id, active state.
